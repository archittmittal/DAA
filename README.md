📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Design and Analysis of Algorithms implementations, focusing primarily on sorting and searching techniques.
All algorithms are implemented using Java and C++, following standard DAA principles such as time complexity, space complexity, and algorithmic efficiency.

🚀 What This Repository Covers
🔹 Sorting Algorithms

Implementations of both basic and advanced sorting techniques, including but not limited to:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Counting Sort

Radix Sort

Each algorithm is implemented with clarity and optimized where applicable, making it suitable for both learning and revision.

🔹 Searching Algorithms

Efficient searching techniques implemented for different use cases:

Linear Search

Binary Search

Recursive & Iterative Variants

Searching on Sorted Arrays

💻 Languages Used

Java – Object-oriented implementations with clean structure

C++ – Efficient and competitive-programming–friendly implementations

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Strengthen understanding of DAA concepts

Practice algorithm implementation in multiple languages

Analyze time and space complexity

Serve as a reference repository for exams, interviews, and competitive programming
